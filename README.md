So, the same old "README" again.
The XP bot is a simple ca.380 line code XP bot.
It gives a user XP in a selected chat channels every time ue writes anything. 
The XP date (how much XP someone has) is saved in a .Jason on you device that's running the code, for example a Linux server..
For the security of the bot there's an anti Spam function that only allows to get XP ever 5 seconds.
Also the mods got commands to set all the things, like the reset some ones XP or give him some XP, or just set the XP-Channel.
The Bot has a /help command for seeing all commands. 
Right Now the /help command has my name in it!!
You can change it in the last part of the code.

Quick command Overview:

/Help --> shows all commands 
/lv_reset --> Resets some ones XP (only for allowed roles)
/setup --> Sets the XP channel where XP is earned
/rank --> shows your Xp status, like what rank you are and so 
/leaderboard --> shows the best 5 users on you server
/set_language --> sets the Language to German/Inglish 
/wipe_all --> resets all XP Data

So I hope the Bot is helpful for you and pal give me Feedback if it works.

Btw. I'm 14 so tell me if I missed something here
